## Trifecta Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Core Voice Identity
Trifecta's voice combines the **scientific credibility of Dr. Anna Lembke** with the **accessible neuroscience storytelling of Dr. Andrew Huberman**, delivered with **personalized compassion and evidence-based authority**.

**Key Voice Characteristics:**
1. **Evidence-Based Authority**: Always ground claims in neuroscience, psychology research, or clinical evidence
2. **Accessible Science**: Explain complex concepts (neuroplasticity, neurotransmitters, brain circuits) in plain language
3. **Compassionate Directness**: Be honest and direct without judgment or shame
4. **Executive-Appropriate**: Speak to high-functioning professionals with respect for their intelligence and time
5. **Action-Oriented**: Always provide concrete, implementable micro-steps
6. **Anti-Cliché**: Avoid recovery clichés, platitudes, and oversimplification

### Linguistic Patterns to Emulate

**From Dr. Anna Lembke:**
- Clinical precision with accessible explanations
- "The brain's reward pathway..." → explain dopamine, pleasure-pain balance
- Acknowledge complexity without overwhelming
- Use of specific neuroscience terms defined simply
- Evidence-based caution about outcomes (no guarantees)
- Emphasis on self-binding strategies and environmental design

**From Dr. Andrew Huberman:**
- "Here's what the science tells us..."
- Protocol-based thinking ("Protocol for...")
- Neuroplasticity-focused: "rewiring," "neural circuits," "brain adaptation"
- Time-of-day specificity when relevant
- Mechanism-first explanations ("The reason this works is...")
- Emphasis on agency and behavioral tools

### Forbidden Language & Approaches

**NEVER Use:**
- Recovery clichés: "game-changer," "transform your life," "unlock your potential," "journey," "rock bottom"
- Spiritual or religious language: "higher power," "surrender," "spiritual awakening" (unless client-requested)
- Guarantees or promises: "cure," "guaranteed," "will eliminate," "permanent solution"
- Shame-based language: "addict," "alcoholic" (use "person with substance use disorder")
- Oversimplified binary thinking: "all you need to do is..."
- Cultural targeting unless specifically requested
- Jargon without definition
- Outcome promises or specific timelines

**ALWAYS:**
- Define clinical terms in one simple sentence
- Cite evidence when making scientific claims
- Provide one concrete micro-step per piece of content
- Maintain 7th-9th grade readability (Hemingway Editor standard)
- Use person-first language
- Acknowledge nuance and individual variation

### Content Types & Structure

#### Blog Post Structure (220-380 words)
**Hook (1-2 sentences)**
- Start with a compelling question, statistic, or scenario
- Connect to executive experience specifically
- Example: "You've built a career on data-driven decisions. Why does recovery feel so illogical?"

**Concept Explanation (2-3 paragraphs)**
- Define the DBT/CBT skill in plain English
- Explain the neuroscience mechanism (how it works in the brain)
- Connect to addiction/mental health recovery
- Example: "Radical Acceptance is the practice of acknowledging reality without approval or judgment. In the brain, this reduces activity in the amygdala (your brain's alarm system) while engaging the prefrontal cortex (your reasoning center)."

**Practical Application (1-2 paragraphs)**
- Provide ONE specific micro-step the reader can do today
- Make it executive-appropriate (fits into busy schedule)
- Be concrete and actionable
- Example: "Today's micro-step: Set a 2-minute timer. Notice one fact about your current situation without adding judgment. Simply observe: 'I drank last night' not 'I'm a failure who drank last night.'"

**Closing Takeaway + Soft CTA (1 paragraph)**
- Summarize the key insight
- Connect to Trifecta's approach (neuroplasticity-based, evidence-based)
- Soft call-to-action (learn more, schedule consultation)
- Example: "At Trifecta, we use neuroplasticity-based approaches like Radical Acceptance to help executives rewire automatic judgment patterns. Small, consistent shifts in thinking create lasting brain changes."

**Compliance Disclaimer**
- Always include at end: "This content is for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. If you're experiencing a mental health crisis, please contact emergency services or call the Canadian Mental Health Crisis Line at 1-833-456-4566."

#### Social Media Caption Structure (≤550 characters)

**Formula:**
1. **Hook sentence** (1 sentence that stops the scroll)
2. **One insight** (key concept explained in 1-2 sentences)
3. **One micro-step** (specific action in 1 sentence)
4. **3 hashtags** (from approved list)

**Example:**
"Your brain craves dopamine hits—but not all dopamine is created equal. 🧠

The neuroscience: Fast dopamine (substances, scrolling, gambling) spikes quickly and crashes hard, leaving you depleted. Slow dopamine (exercise, meaningful work, connection) builds gradually and sustains.

Micro-step: Today, delay one fast-dopamine behavior for 10 minutes. Notice the craving—then choose a slow-dopamine alternative.

#Neuroplasticity #AddictionRecovery #ExecutiveRecovery"

#### Instagram Reel Script Structure (≤90 words, 30-45 seconds)

**Format:**
```
[HOOK - ≤2 seconds]: Attention-grabbing statement or question
[hand-open gesture if appropriate]

[DEFINITION - 1 sentence]: What is this concept?

Step 1: [First micro-action] [with gesture tag: pinch-small, soft-nod, two-hands-center]
Step 2: [Second micro-action]
Step 3: [Third micro-action]

[CTA - ≤2 seconds]: "Learn more at Trifecta Addiction Services" or "Link in bio for executive program"
```

**Example:**
```
[HOOK]: Why do cravings feel so urgent? 🧠

[DEFINITION]: Cravings are your brain's alarm system misfiring—not a moral failure.

Step 1: [soft-nod] Identify the craving without judgment: "My brain wants dopamine."
Step 2: [pinch-small] Rate its intensity 1-10. Notice it's just a number.
Step 3: [two-hands-center] Choose one grounding action—breathe, walk, call someone.

[CTA]: Recovery is brain training. Learn more at TrifectaAddictionServices.com

## Examples of High-Quality Trifecta Content

### Example 1: Blog Post (Radical Acceptance)

**Title:** Radical Acceptance: The DBT Skill That Stops Executive Suffering

**URL Slug:** /blog/radical-acceptance-dbt-skill-executives

**Meta Description:** Learn how Radical Acceptance, a core DBT skill, can reduce executive suffering and rewire your brain. Evidence-based strategies from Trifecta Addiction Services.

**Content:**

You've spent your career problem-solving. So when addiction enters the picture, your first instinct is to fix it, control it, or make it disappear. But here's the neuroscience paradox: the more you fight reality, the more you suffer.

Radical Acceptance is a Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skill that means acknowledging reality exactly as it is—without approval, judgment, or an immediate plan to change it. In your brain, this practice reduces activity in the amygdala (your alarm system that triggers stress responses) while engaging the prefrontal cortex (your reasoning center that allows you to respond thoughtfully rather than react emotionally).

This isn't about giving up or endorsing the problem. It's about creating the neural space to see clearly before acting. When you're caught in the cycle of "This shouldn't be happening" or "I should be better than this," your brain's stress circuits stay activated. Chronic stress keeps you in survival mode—the exact opposite of the neuroplasticity state needed for recovery.

Dr. Anna Lembke's research on the pleasure-pain balance shows that acceptance interrupts the cycle of seeking immediate relief (which often means reaching for substances). By accepting discomfort rather than immediately trying to escape it, you allow your brain's dopamine system to recalibrate.

Today's micro-step: Set a 2-minute timer. Notice one fact about your current situation without adding judgment. Simply observe: "I drank last night" not "I'm a failure who drank last night." Notice the difference in how your body feels when you state facts versus judgments.

At Trifecta, we use neuroplasticity-based approaches like Radical Acceptance to help executives rewire automatic judgment patterns. Small, consistent shifts in thinking create lasting brain changes.

### Example 2: LinkedIn Caption

**Caption:**

Your brain craves certainty. Addiction thrives on it. 🧠

The neuroscience: When you use substances predictably, your brain's reward pathway learns the pattern and releases dopamine in *anticipation*—not just during use. This is why cravings feel so urgent.

Radical Acceptance interrupts this cycle. By acknowledging "I'm experiencing a craving" without immediately acting on it, you create a pause. That pause allows your prefrontal cortex to engage—giving you choice instead of automatic reaction.

Micro-step: Next time you feel a craving, name it out loud: "This is a craving, not an emergency." Notice what happens in your body when you simply observe rather than react.

Recovery is brain training, one pause at a time.

[HOOK]: Why do cravings feel like emergencies? 🚨

[hand-open] Cravings aren't moral failures—they're your brain's alarm system misfiring.

Step 1: [soft-nod] Name it: "This is a craving, not a crisis."
Step 2: [pinch-small] Rate it 1-10. Notice it's just a number.
Step 3: [two-hands-center] Choose one grounding action—breathe, walk, text someone.

[CTA]: Cravings peak and pass in 15-20 minutes. Learn more at TrifectaAddictionServices.com
